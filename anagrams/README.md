# :repeat: Anagrams Kata :repeat:

## Description

For example, the potential anagrams of `"biro"` are:
- biro bior brio broi boir bori
- ibro ibor irbo irob iobr iorb
- rbio rboi ribo riob roib robi
- obir obri oibr oirb orbi orib

## Objective

The main objective of this kata is to improve your algorithmic thinking and your ability to solve problems using code.

Using TDD to solve the kata is a plus.
