## Description
  
Write a program to generate all potential anagrams of an input string.

> An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

For example, the potential anagrams of `"biro"` are:
- biro bior brio broi boir bori
- ibro ibor irbo irob iobr iorb
- rbio rboi ribo riob roib robi
- obir obri oibr oirb orbi orib

## Objective

The main objective of this kata is to improve your algorithmic thinking and your ability to solve problems using code.

Using TDD to solve the kata is a plus.
