# :date: Leap Year Kata :date:

## Description
  
Write a function that:
- Receives an integer as input.
- Returns `True` if the input is a leap year
- Returns `False` if the input is not a leap year

A leap year must follow these rules:

- A year is not leap if it is not divisible by 4
- A year is leap if it is divisible by 4
- A year is leap if it is divisible by 400
- A year is not leap if it is divisible by 100 but not by 400

## Objective

The main objective of this kata is to improve logic skills in Python.

Additionally, TDD is going to be used as methodology to develop the function.

## Examples

- 1997 is not leap (not divisible by 4)
- 1996 is leap (divisible by 4)
- 1600 is leap (divisible by 400)
- 1800 is not leap (divisible by 4, divisible by 100, NOT divisible by 400)
