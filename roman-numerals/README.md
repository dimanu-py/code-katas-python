# :scroll: Roman Numerals Kata :scroll:

## Description

Write a function to convert Arabic numbers to Roman numerals following the TDD practices.

Given a positive integer number (for example, 42), determine its Roman numeral representation as a string (for example, XLII). 
You cannot write numerals like IM for 999.

To test the function use some edge cases such as: 846, 1999, 2008 adn 3999

## Objective

The objective of this kata is to practice TDD and apply TPP (Transformation Priority Premise) to solve the problem.
