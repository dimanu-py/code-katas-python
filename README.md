## Project

This repository contains a collection of coding katas solved in Python. The main objective of this repository is to practice and learn Python.

The project will have one folder per kata. Each folder will contain the following files:

* **README.md**: description of the kata and what we want to learn or practice.
* **test_kata.py**: unit tests for the kata.
* **kata.py**: implementation of the kata.
